# meetr

meetr is an app that helps you build and maintain your relationships, whether that be for close friends or distant acquaintances. You can specify how often you would ideally like to see them, and meetr will send you SMS reminders thanks to Twilioâ„¢. You can also quickly and easily track your "meets" and store important information in each friend's profile, allowing you to remember what you last discussed or developments in their life. And of course, meetr takes your privacy very seriously, and your friends list and meet history is entirely private. With meetr's features, you can stay closer to those around you.
